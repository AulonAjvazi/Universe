        <ol class="du">
            <li>Definition: The universe is everything that exists, including all matter, energy, space, and time.</li>
            <li>Components: It contains galaxies, stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and cosmic dust.</li>
            <li>Structure: The universe is vast and largely empty, with galaxies grouped in clusters and superclusters.</li>
            <li>Expansion: The universe is expanding, meaning galaxies are moving away from each other over time.</li>
            <li>Age: The universe is estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old, originating from the Big Bang.</li>
            <li>Dark Matter and Dark Energy: Most of the universe's mass-energy content is made up of dark matter (which we can't see) and dark energy (which is driving its expansion).</li>

        <ul>
        <li><br><span>The Milky Way (Our Galaxy)</span>
            <br><span>Structure:</span><br>The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with a central bulge and curved arms that spiral outwards. <br>It has hundreds of billions of stars, including our Sun.
            Location: <br>Our Solar System is located in one of the Milky Wayâ€™s spiral arms, called the Orion Arm, about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center.
            Size: <br>It spans about 100,000 light-years across.
            Black Hole: <br>At the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole named Sagittarius A*.</li>
            <hr>
        <li><span> Galaxies:</span><br>
            <span>Example:</span><br>Andromeda Galaxy (M31)
            Structure: <br>They have a flat, rotating disk with spiral arms, a bulging center, and are often rich in gas and dust, which allows for star formation.
            Description: <br>These galaxies are among the most beautiful and include the Milky Way.</li>
        <li>Elliptical Galaxies:<br>
            <hr>
            <span>Example:</span><br>M87 in the Virgo Cluster
            Structure: <br>These galaxies range from almost spherical to elongated ovals and lack the distinct arms seen in spiral galaxies.
            Description:<br>They contain older stars and little gas or dust, so they have less new star formation.</li>
        <li>Irregular Galaxies:<br>
            <hr>
            <span>Example:</span><br>Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
            Structure: <br>These galaxies have no distinct shape, often due to gravitational interactions or collisions with other galaxies.
            Description: <br>They are often rich in gas and dust and can be sites of intense star formation.</li>
